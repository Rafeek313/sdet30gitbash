Hi all,

Today is my last day at Tracxn.

It has been an amazing journey, working and interacting with each one of you. I have grown both professionally and personally at Tracxn. I would take this opportunity to thank my mentors, Bhaskar and Rama, who have provided me with support and guidance throughout my tenure here.

It has been a pleasure working with you all and I wish each one of you all the best for your future endeavours.

I am including my contact details below. Feel free to reach out anytime.
